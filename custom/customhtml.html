    <h5>Interesting facts about animals:</h5>

    <p>Cats don't see humans as humans, they see us as huge cats, they consider us their species.</p>

    <h2>NATURE</h2>
    <h5> Breathtaking views </h5>

    <p>A wonderful and mysterious world of nature. Listen to the murmur of river jets, birds singing, rustling of grasses, buzzing of bumblebees and you will understand it. Have you seen the sun at dawn? The sun turns into a small, but still, holiday,
       every ordinary and everyday day of man</p>

    <p>Sages and dreamers of the past tried more than once to enumerate the "wonders of the world" - wonders created by nature and created by human hands. They talked about seven miracles, looked for and found an eighth, but it seems that no one ever mentioned a miracle - the only one known to us in the Universe. This miracle is our planet itself, 
      together with the atmosphere - the refuge and guardian of life.</p>

      Wind and sun, forest and water give us common joy, shape character, make it softer, more poetic. Humans are by nature inextricably linked by thousands of threads. Human life depends on the state of nature. Nature protection concerns all of us. We all breathe the same air of the Earth, drink water and eat bread, whose molecules
       continuously participate in an endless cycle of substances.</p>
